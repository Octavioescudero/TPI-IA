Self-knowledge (psychology),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-knowledge_(psychology),1941913,"Self-knowledge is a term used in psychology to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding answers to the questions ""What am I like?"" and ""Who am I?"".","Self-knowledge is a term used in psychology to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding answers to the questions ""What am I like?"" and ""Who am I?"". While seeking to develop the answer to this question, self-knowledge requires ongoing self-awareness and self-consciousness (which is not to be confused with consciousness). Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness and agencycontingency, yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of cognition, however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask ""What am I like?"", and to answer with self-knowledge, though self-knowledge has limits, as introspection has been said to be limited and complex. Self-knowledge is a component of the self or, more accurately, the self-concept. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the desire to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept, even if that concept is flawed. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic, to the best that we can evaluate ourselves. The self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects: The cognitive self The affective self The executive self The affective and executive selves are also known as the felt and active selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept. Self-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our true self; for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the known self. The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or think we know) about ourselves. This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few. Self knowledge just simply means introspecting your behaviour and actions from a third persons view to the various situations faced in life and then trying to identify the causes of these issues in life.",11,2331

He was a cabinet member during President Iskandar Ali Mirza's tenure, holding various ministries during president Ayub Khan's military rule from 1958. Bhutto became the Foreign Minister in 1963, advocating for Operation Gibraltar in Kashmir, leading to the 1965 war with India. Following the Tashkent Declaration, he was dismissed from the government. Bhutto established the PPP in 1967, focusing on an Islamic socialist agenda, and contested the 1970 general election. The Awami League and PPP were unable to agree on power transfer, leading to civil unrest and the creation of Bangladesh.

Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats_for_Europe_Party,9865,"The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party is a European political party composed of 76 national-level parties from across Europe, mainly active in the European Union. The ALDE Party is affiliated with Liberal International and a recognised European political party, incorporated as a non-profit association under Belgian law.","The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE Party) is a European political party composed of 76 national-level parties from across Europe, mainly active in the European Union. The ALDE Party is affiliated with Liberal International and a recognised European political party, incorporated as a non-profit association under Belgian law. It was founded on 26 March 1976 in Stuttgart as a confederation of national political parties under the name ""Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe"" and renamed ""European Liberals and Democrats"" (ELD) in 1977 and ""European Liberal Democrats and Reformists"" (ELDR) in 1986. On 30 April 2004, the ELDR was reformed as an official European party, the ""European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party"" (ELDR Party). On 10 November 2012, under the leadership of Sir Graham Watson MEP, the party chose its current name ALDE Party, taken from its then-European Parliament group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), which had been formed on 20 July 2004 in conjunction with the European Democratic Party (EDP). Prior to the 2004 European election, the European party had been represented through its own group, the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Group (ELDR) Group. In June 2019, the ALDE group was succeeded by Renew Europe. As of 2024, ALDE Party is represented in European Union institutions, with 51 MEPs and five members of the European Commission. Of the 27 EU member states, there are two with ALDE-affiliated Prime Ministers: Kristen Michal (Estonian Reform Party) in Estonia and Alexander De Croo (Open VLD) in Belgium. ALDE Party members are also in governments in ten other EU member states: Cyprus, France, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Ireland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Germany and the Netherlands. Charles Michel, former Belgian prime minister, was the president of the European Council until December 2024. ALDE's think tank is the European Liberal Forum, led by Jan-Christoph Oetjen MEP, and gathers 46 member organisations. The youth wing of ALDE is the European Liberal Youth (LYMEC), which is predominantly based upon youth and student liberal organisations but contains also a small number of individual members. LYMEC is led by Ines Holzegger. In 2011, ALDE Party became the first pan-European party to create the status of individual membership. Since then, between 1000 and close to 3000 members (the numbers fluctuate annually) maintained direct membership in the ALDE Party from several EU countries. Over 40 coordinators mobilised liberal ideas, initiatives and expertise across the continent under the leadership of the steering committee, which was first chaired by Julie Cantalou. The ALDE Party took a step further in the direction of becoming a truly pan-European party when granting voting rights to individual members delegates at the Party Congress. Individual membership was eventually discontinued in 2023.",14,2925

One of the largest and most secretive intelligence organizations in the world, it maintains powerful semi-autonomous branches at the provincial, city, municipality and township levels throughout China. The ministry's headquarters, Yidongyuan, is a large compound in Beijing's Haidian district.","The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is the principal civilian intelligence and security service of the People's Republic of China, responsible for foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and defense of the political security and honor of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). One of the largest and most secretive intelligence organizations in the world, it maintains powerful semi-autonomous branches at the provincial, city, municipality and township levels throughout China. The ministry's headquarters, Yidongyuan, is a large compound in Beijing's Haidian district. The origins of the MSS begin with the CCP's Central Special Branch, better known as the Teke, which was replaced by the Central Social Affairs Department from 1936 through the proclamation of the People's Republic in 1949. In 1955, the department was replaced with the Central Investigation Department, which existed in various configurations through the Cultural Revolution to 1983, when it was merged with counterintelligence elements of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) to form the MSS. An executive department of the State Council, the contemporary MSS is an all-source intelligence organization with a broad mandate and expansive authorities to undertake global campaigns of espionage and covert action on the so-called ""hidden front."" Within China, the ministry leverages extrajudicial law enforcement authorities to achieve its domestic objectives: Its State Security Police serve as a secret police authorized to detain and interrogate people in what is known as ""an invitation to tea."" Those remanded by state security are detained in the ministry's own detention facilities. Outside the mainland, the ministry is best known for its numerous advanced persistent threat groups, some outsourced to contractors, which carry out prolific industrial and cyber espionage campaigns. The ministry has also been implicated in political and transnational repression and harassment of dissidents abroad. Its influence operations, often orchestrated in collaboration with the United Front Work Department, have led national policy, originating phrases like ""China's peaceful rise"" and ""great changes unseen in a century"", which have become staples of Chinese diplomatic rhetoric internationally. Once rarely acknowledged, in recent years the ministry has drastically increased its public profile, publishing a manga series, and a recruitment video starring Li Yifeng. While its inner workings remain opaque, propaganda posters about national security branded with the ministry's seal are now a common sight on billboards and public transit in Chinese cities, and its daily WeChat posts receive millions of views. Estimates of the ministry's size range from 110,000 to 800,000 employees, with most believed to be spread across the dozens of semi-autonomous bureaus located across the country.",12,2864
